My task was to research REST using videos from sites such as Youtube. There was a whole list of different videos outlining 
what REST was and also what a restful architecture was and what it involved, there were two good very detailed videos about it
which I felt outlined what REST is[1] and also what a Restful architecture was made up of[2] the best. I then looked up some of 
the different topics that were covered in the video just to understand them a little better[3].

My task was to research GUI design. To begin with I looked up User interface and interaction design in relation to GUI's to get
a general understanding [1] of how it should be designed [2] and what different tools [3] were there that would be helpful to 
use. I then looked furter into what tools people currently prefer to use [4] . While looking at that i came accross different
techniques [5] that were used to test user interfaces quickly, one of which being Paper prototyping [6] . I thought this method 
would work the best for testing potential designs because of how quick and easy it was to do and how much time it would save 
later on so I choose Paper Prototyping as the place where I could start GUI design.

My task was to research more advanced AI in relation to Battleships. To begin with I looked up already existing methods to win
at battleship. I came across a number of different methods some more complex [3] than others [1][2]. All of the different 
methods involved a hunt/target methodology so i decided that i would base my code on that and if time allowed fine tune the
hunt method so that instead of randomly selecting positions it would select them based off of probability as seen in [3].

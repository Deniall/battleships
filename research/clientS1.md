My task was to research REST using books and journals. In the DCU library, there was very little content on REST; one scholarly publication and a Python book [1] I found that went into quite a nice bit of detail. From that book I learned that we probably wanted to use a Python web framework so I googled different types of Python web frameworks. I looked at 3 or 4 different options and narrowed it down to Flask and Bottle, which I did a bit more testing on before making a final decision to use Flask as it only required a couple of lines to get a server running.

To start the server run `python server.py` in the command line. It will operate on port 80. 

You need to have the PyMongo library installed to run the server. There are instructions on how to install it [here](http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/installation.html).
You will also need a MongoDB installation running locally. You can download it [here](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads#production).

See the Wiki for info on the structure of the database.

The players.json and games.json files are not used, but are currently serving as examples of the contents of the game and player records in the database.
